$ git clone https://github.com/guidocecilio/angular-xeditable-demo.git

# change directory to your app

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.1.x`+) and NPM (`2.14.x`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:8080`.

## Developing

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm start`

### The code
[Angular Style Guide ES2015/ES6](https://github.com/rwwagner90/angular-styleguide-es6)

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`

## Webpack
[angularks-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angularjs-webpack)

This workflow serves as a starting point for building Angular 1.x applications using Webpack 2.x. Should be noted that apart from the pre-installed angular package, this workflow is pretty much generic.

* Heavily commented webpack configuration with reasonable defaults.
* ES6, and ES7 support with babel.
* Source maps included in all builds.
* Development server with live reload.
* Production builds with cache busting.
* Testing environment using karma to run tests and jasmine as the framework.
* Code coverage when tests are run.
* No gulp and no grunt, just npm scripts.

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM
